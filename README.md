# Introduction

Visual prompting offers a powerful alternative to traditional training. Instead of curating thousands of labeled images, you simply show the model one or a few examples of what you are looking for. The model effectively "learns" instantly, detecting and segmenting similar objects in new images or live video streams without retraining.

## Key Features

- **Library & Application**: A unified framework providing a **modular Python library** for research and development, and a **Full-Stack Application** for deploying those algorithms on live video streams.
- **Simple & Modular API**: A composable design where developers can mix and match components (backbones, matchers) to create custom pipelines.
- **Algorithms & Models**: A wide collection of ready-to-use zero-shot and few-shot algorithms (e.g., **SAM 2**, **Matcher**, **GroundedSAM**) and foundation models.
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Built-in support for model optimization and export to [**OpenVINO™**](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/openvino-toolkit/overview.html) for fast inference on Intel hardware (CPU, GPU, NPU).
- **Multiple Backends**: Seamless switching between **PyTorch** for flexibility/research and **OpenVINO** for optimized deployment.

## Getting Started

Geti Instant Learn consists of two core components:

- **Python Library**: The foundation for research and zero/few shots algorithm development.
- **Full Stack Application**: Leverages the library to enable real-time inference on live streams, video files, and images.

<details>
<summary> Prerequisites </summary>

- **Python 3.12+**
- **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** (Python package manager)
- **[Just](https://github.com/casey/just)** (Command runner)
- **Node.js (v24.2.0)** (Required only for the UI Application)
- **Docker** (Optional, for containerized deployment)

</details>

### Geti Instant Learn Library

Install the library:

```bash
cd library
uv sync --extra xpu    # Intel XPU (recommended)
uv sync --extra cpu    # CPU only
uv sync --extra gpu    # CUDA support
```

Or with pip:

```bash
pip install ./library[xpu]  # or [cpu], [gpu]
```

#### SAM3: Zero-Shot Text Prompting

SAM3 performs zero-shot segmentation using text prompts (category names) or bounding boxes — no reference mask needed.
You provide a list of categories you want to segment in any image.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme-sam3-example.png" alt="SAM3 Example: Text-prompted segmentation on multiple elephant images">
</p>

```python
from instantlearn.models import SAM3
from instantlearn.data import Sample

# Initialize SAM3 (device: "xpu", "cuda", or "cpu")
model = SAM3(device="xpu")

# SAM3 is zero-shot — no fit() required. Just provide categories per sample.
predictions = model.predict([
    Sample(image_path="library/examples/assets/coco/000000286874.jpg", categories=["elephant"]),
    Sample(image_path="library/examples/assets/coco/000000173279.jpg", categories=["elephant"]),
])
```

> **Tip:** Calling `model.fit(sample)` is optional for SAM3. If called, the fitted
> categories are reused for all subsequent `predict()` calls so you don't need to
> specify categories on every target sample. If not called, categories are taken from
> each target sample directly.

For more examples of SAM3 capabilities, see the [SAM3 aerial & maritime notebook](library/examples/sam3_aerial_maritime_example.ipynb).

Since SAM3 requires a text prompt for every sample (unless `fit()` is used), this is where **Matcher** comes in —
you fit once with a reference mask (one-shot) and predict on any number of new images without providing prompts again.

#### Matcher: One-Shot Visual Prompting

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme-matcher-example.png" alt="Matcher Example: Reference Image → Reference Mask → 3 Predictions">
</p>

```python
from instantlearn.models import Matcher
from instantlearn.data import Sample

# Initialize Matcher (device: "xpu", "cuda", or "cpu")
model = Matcher(device="xpu")

# Create reference sample (auto-loads image and mask from paths)
ref_sample = Sample(
    image_path="library/examples/assets/coco/000000286874.jpg",
    mask_paths="library/examples/assets/coco/000000286874_mask.png",
)

# Fit once on reference
model.fit(ref_sample)

# Predict on multiple target images — no prompts needed
predictions = model.predict([
    "library/examples/assets/coco/000000390341.jpg",
    "library/examples/assets/coco/000000173279.jpg",
    "library/examples/assets/coco/000000267704.jpg",
])

# Access results for each image
for pred in predictions:
    masks = pred["pred_masks"]  # Predicted segmentation masks
```

> For interactive mask generation with SAM, CLI usage, and benchmarking, see the [Library README](library/README.md).
