    """Greedy NMS using a precomputed overlap matrix.

    Supports **containment-aware suppression** when both ``areas`` and
    ``score_margin`` are provided.  In standard greedy NMS, a small
    high-scored mask (e.g. a cat's eye) suppresses a large lower-scored
    mask (e.g. the whole cat body) because the eye overlaps heavily
    with the body (IoM ≈ 1).  With containment-awareness enabled, if
    the winner is *truly contained inside* the loser (winner area <
    loser area * ``area_ratio``) *and* the score difference is within
    ``score_margin``, the larger mask is preferred and the smaller one
    is suppressed instead.

    The ``area_ratio`` guard prevents false containment swaps between
    similarly-sized masks (e.g. two body masks at 90 k vs 92 k pixels).
    Only when the winner is **significantly** smaller than the loser
    (e.g. eye 2 k inside body 90 k → ratio 0.02 < 0.5) does the swap
    trigger.

    Args:
        scores: Confidence scores ``[N]``.
        overlap_matrix: Pairwise overlap values ``[N, N]`` (IoU or IoM).
        threshold: Overlap threshold for suppression.
        areas: Per-mask areas ``[N]``.  Required for containment check.
        score_margin: Maximum score gap below which the larger mask is
            preferred over the smaller contained one.  ``None`` disables
            the containment logic (standard greedy NMS).
        area_ratio: Maximum winner/loser area ratio that counts as true
            containment.  The swap only triggers when
            ``areas[winner] < areas[loser] * area_ratio``.
            Default: ``0.5`` (winner must be less than half the loser's

        When containment-aware mode swaps out a winner ``idx`` (marking it
        suppressed), any masks that ``idx`` already suppressed in the current
        inner-loop iteration remain suppressed. This is intentional: those
        masks had lower scores than ``idx`` and would typically also be
        suppressed by the replacement winner ``jdx`` (which has a similar

class SoftNMS(PostProcessor):
    """Soft-NMS with Gaussian score decay on mask IoU.

    Instead of hard suppression, scores are decayed proportionally
    to overlap::

        s_i <- s_i * exp(-IoU^2 / sigma)

    Masks whose decayed score falls below ``score_threshold`` are removed.
    This is gentler than hard NMS and works better when nearby distinct
    objects have overlapping masks.
